                        <p>Over the last two decades, Cloud Computing has revolutionized the technological landscape,
                            allowing companies to rent infrastructure instead of building rapidly-obsolescing hardware
                            on-site. During this time, the architectual approach that combines infrastructure
                            orchestration and application code into cloud services has evolved.</p>

                        <p>Today, cloud users have a choice between technology stacks for virtual hosts, master-slave
                            architectures, and container cluster. Each stack wraps application code differently, relies
                            on different methods to launch server, and provides different mechansims to automate
                            fail-over and scaling processes. For Enterprise IT organizations, managing a large variety
                            of applications, choosing one particular stack is usually not sufficient, because a single
                            stack can not address the broad variety of functional and non-functional requirements.</p>

                        <p>Hence, spreading workloads accross multiple cloud providers is a common strategy to address
                            this constraint. However, deploying private workloads accross multiple public infrastructure
                            stacks increases operational complexity significantly and comes with certain
                            vulneribilities.</p>

                        <p>Adopting a second generation infrastructure service (IaaS) like <a
                                href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/?source=:ex:tb:::::WWMK211125P00022:WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&SC=:ex:tb:::::WWMK211125P00022:WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&pcode=WWMK211125P00022">Oracle
                                Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)</a> is an attractive alternative. Purpose-built hardware
                            enables cloud providers to separate the orchestration layer from the hosts and allows cloud
                            customers to build private data centers on pre-built infrastructure pools. Programming
                            interfaces allow operators to build extensible service delivery platforms and service owners
                            to modernize applications in incremental steps. The bare metal approach allows customers to
                            run enterprise applications in a traditional way. Cloud orchestrators remain optional, and
                            can be added as managed service, but even then the user remains in control over the
                            infrastructure resources.</p>

                        <p><a
                                href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/architecture-and-regions.html?source=:ex:tb:::::WWMK211125P00022:WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&SC=:ex:tb:::::WWMK211125P00022:WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&pcode=WWMK211125P00022"><img

                        <p>Oracle operates a fast-growing network of data centers to provide access to pre-built cloud
                            infrastructure in more than 30 regions. In addition, Oracle builds private infrastructure
                            pools on-demand, and offers to extend these pools with edge compute or database nodes. In
                            every data center, dedicated compute and storage resources are isolated on a native layer
                            three network. Orchestrators, including hypervisor, container, and network functions remain
                            private by default - also in shared pools. Combining open-source orchestration technologies
                            with cloud agnostic monitoring and management services allows operators to build a control
                            center for hybrid cloud services.</p>

                        <p>End to end programmability ensures fast and flexible resource deployments, with platform
                            components like middleware, integration, and database infrastructure — provided either as
                            managed or as unmanaged service — offer a choice between convenience and control. In any
                            case, standard hardware controls like the <a

                        <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a deep and broad platform of public cloud services that
                            enables customers to build and run a wide range of applications in a scalable, secure,
                            highly available, and high-performance environment.</p>

                        <p>For on-premises requirements, OCI is available with the new Dedicated Region
                            Cloud@Customer—behind a company’s private firewall and in their data center.</p>

                        <p>Cloud operations engineering is a relatively new field which extends the scope of IT service
                            management (ITSM). It represents an important step towards more agility and flexibility in
                            service operation. The concept of “Infrastructure as Code” replaces runbook tools and has
                            become an enabler of self-service delivery — even for complex solution architectures.
                            Operators empower service owners and developers to add, change or delete infrastructure on
                            demand with deployment templates for logical resources. Service consumers gain flexibility
                            to provision virtual infrastructure, while resource operators remain in control of the
                            physical infrastructure.</p>

                        <p>This series aims to provide a path for IT organizations introducing cloud engineering. We
                            starts with a short introduction of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), show how to define logical
                            resources for application and database services, and end with an example showing how to
                            consolidate infrastructure and application services in a self-service catalogue. We’ll build
