                        <h2 id="welcome-to-proximasafe-an-evolution-of-smart-cities">Welcome to ProximaSafe, an
                            evolution of Smart Cities!</h2>

                        <p>Wait, what on Earth is Proxima and why is it Safe?</p>

                        <p>Great questions.</p>

                        <p>In 2018, Oracle developed ProximaCity, a physical product showcasing how cloud services can
                            optimize the
                            resource-intensive processes which make communities functional. This was an exciting
                            outgrowth of Oracle’s
                            <a
                                href="https://www.oracle.com/industries/public-sector/smart-cities/?source=:ex:tb::::::WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&SC=:ex:tb::::::WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&pcode=">Smart
                                City</a> initiative. It was a big hit.
                        </p>

                        <p>Then there was a pandemic.</p>

                        <p>ProximaCity needed to adapt from a sprawling physical model to something more streamlined.
                            Optimization was
                            still a priority, but safety came first.</p>

                        <p>Enter ProximaSafe.</p>

                        <p>ProximaSafe extends the goals of the old ProximaCity, but uses data to proactively defend
                            against biological
                            threats (monitoring environmental parameters and ensuring sanitation stations, for example).
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="what-to-expect-from-this-series">What to expect from this series</h3>

                        <p>This series walks you through creating a personal development lab which you can build at
                            home, or just read
                            to follow along. The theme of the lab, its use cases and sample data, borrows from the COVID
                            pandemic. Using
                            APIs, edge components, and sensors, you’ll use OCI services to build safety-related use
                            cases.</p>

                        <p>The goal here is to enable teachers, students, developers, and tinkerers to use and improve
                            this “portable
                            lab” and develop new safety-oriented use cases to explore and expand its necessary back-end
                            cloud services.
                        </p>

                        <h2 id="the-briefcase-dream">The Briefcase Dream</h2>

                        <p>I’ve always been a fan of Marvel superheroes comics, long before the successful movie
                            franchise known as MCU.
                            Actually, around 1972–1975, I could find several Marvel comics carefully translated and
                            lettered in my
                            native language by visiting my friendly (actually, he wasn’t) news vendor, strategically
                            placed in the
                            market street corner few hundred yards from where I lived.</p>

                        <p>The hard limit — at the time — was the number of physical coins I was allowed to spend within
                            a month without
                            incurring into Mum’s inevitable semi-verbal reproach.</p>

                        <p>Few years later, my tastes and interests turned to the Golden Age Sci-Fi (Asimov and all of
                            the Futurians,
                            Heinlein, Bradbury ). The news vendor corner was always there, my monthly allowance was a
                            tad more generous
                            and I could smuggle sci-fi books in my school bag without arousing suspicion. With a notable
                            exception:
                            pooled with the books, a comic, the Iron Man episode where the iconic Mr. Stark briefcase
                            was introduced to
                            my ‘magnets and miracles’ world.</p>

                        <p>I wish I had that briefcase available in a number of situations, getting a bad grade or
                            running into the
                            inevitable school bully: my curiosity about the relationship between miniaturization and
                            technology remains
                            a fixed point even today.</p>

                        <p>Then, decades later, the briefcase idea surfaced again while having fun with an iteration of
                            the Oracle’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJUSEEagm8Q">Proxima City</a> model
                            made by the Italian Innovation
                            Team, a whimsical (as it’s been called) construction made with Legos, Arduinos, sensors and
                            Oracle Cloud
                            Infrastructure services.</p>

                        <p>During the 2020 lockdown we had no access to the city model, installed in the Customer Visit
                            Center in Rome.
                            I was struggling to find a way to show a functioning demo either via Zoom or bringing some
                            artifacts into
                            customer premises (no Star Trek transporter available, so far), and urged to prepare
                            something smaller than
                            a city model but powerful enough to show the concept.</p>

                        <p>“I should definitely do it” was my inner morning echo while sipping my favorite daily
                            americano brew.
                            Changing the model to be portable also meant changing the use cases perimeter: the year 2020
                            required — for
                            obvious reasons — a rapid transition from Smart City services to an extended and appropriate
                            Safe City
                            scenario.</p>

                        <picture class="aligncenter">
                            <source srcset=" https://cool.devo.build/proxima-safe/assets/bread.jpeg 1x" />

                        </picture>

                        <p>Requirements were clear: small enough to fit in my backpack, programmable, made with
                            off-the-shelf
                            components, easily connectable to OCI services, and capable to show the end-to-end message
                            flow by means of
                            physical interaction. The stretch goal was to enable teachers, students, developer and
                            tinkerers to improve
                            this ‘portable lab’ and develop new use cases oriented to safety, exploring and expanding
                            the needed
                            back-end cloud services.</p>

                        <p>Here’s the link (Note: insert link) to the article series about what I call
                            <strong>ProximaSafe</strong>,
                            showing how to build some Cloud and Edge capabilities to make a testbed for safety-related
                            applications
                            (included, but not limited to) using a number of technologies and tools, such as:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Oracle Golden Gate Streaming Analytics</strong>, to analyze data in motion and
                                detect anomalies
                                and/or errors</li>
                            <li><strong>OCI Streaming</strong>, the messaging backbone</li>
                            <li><strong>OCI Functions</strong>, the serverless infrastructure used to enable the
                                upstream messages to
                                Edge</li>
                            <li>the <strong>M5Stack</strong> family of development boards, acting as Edge Components
                                enabled to publish
                                and subscribe to IoT topics</li>
                            <li>a <strong>Raspberry Pi 4</strong>, the inevitable Edge gateway taking care of
                                communication between
                                sensors &amp; boards to Cloud — and viceversa</li>
                            <li>a suitable battery pack to power the whole stuff.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The overall architecture designed for this mobile lab includes the representation of the edge
                            (the boards
                            inside the briefcase) and the communication flow edge -&gt; OCI -&gt; edge with return
                            messages containing
                            anomaly detections and alarms.</p>

                        <p>So, given a number of messages that can be recognized as an uptrend/downtrend pattern or a
                            number of messages
                            within a time frame (maybe few seconds), the stream analysis within OCI may (or may not)
                            throw an alarm,
                            sent back to the edge to make something happen.</p>

                        <p>Here’s a <a href="https://youtu.be/dw_odrtwAUk">short YouTube video</a>.</p>

                        <p><strong>Three chapters, a common goal</strong></p>

                        <p>I’ve divided the whole path in chapters that will be published every fortnight or something,
                            trying to avoid
                            the ‘War and Peace’ syndrome (I’m not sure I achieved that). Here’s the breakdown of the
                            articles:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In <strong>chapter 1</strong>, we’ll set up OCI resources to implement an even-driven
                                engine, capable of
                                analyzing the stream of events (and data) from the edge</li>
                            <li>In <strong>chapter 2</strong>, we’ll set up the feedback mechanism to return alarms to
                                the edge in order
                                to make something happen locally
                                In the <strong>final chapter</strong> (three is the magic number), we’ll select and
                                program the edge
                                components (thingies in our briefcase) and we’ll design some pipelines in the cloud
                                corresponding to a
                                number of use cases.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>It was fun to build it. The boy I used to be would be proud of it.</p>

                        <p>The briefcase needs more engineering. I became no Tony, no superpowers, no millionaire, and —
                            overall — my
                            once dark goatee has become white (alas!), so the distant reflection of that boy slipping
                            comics and books
                            in the backpack while wondering about future technology maybe it’s gone forever. My morning
                            back pain
                            reminds me that, indeed, it is.</p>

                        <p>Well, here’s the <a
                                href="https://developer.oracle.com/proximasafe-intro/?source=:ex:tb::::::WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&SC=:ex:tb::::::WW_FY22_DevRel_DotBuild&pcode=">link
                                to the first chapter</a>, for it is time to think about the next thing to write.</p>

                        <p>I still daydream about that magical briefcase, though.</p>
